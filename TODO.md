# TODO

- [ ] modifier system -- instead of changing values to components, add/remove modifiers that are calculated on evaluation
- [ ] FX system -- a list of effects that get rendered on top of everything
- [ ] drawing in sorted layers -- so that components, shadows and effects can overlap
- [ ] detailed evaluation UI (show more stats and each restrictions)
- [ ] name and logo :)
- [ ] sound fx
- [ ] backgrounds
- [ ] tutorial popups
- [ ] levels...
